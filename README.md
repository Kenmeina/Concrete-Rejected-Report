# Concrete Rejected Report

## Description

This Functional Specification Document outlines the complete requirements and scope of the Concrete Rejected Report application. It defines the mutually agreed design prerequisites and the set of features that must be implemented within the project scope.

### Introduction

This document contains the user requirements for a Concrete Rejected Report system. It will also serve as guidance for the project team members and assist them in managing the project in the correct direction. The content of this document is based on various discussions and agreements with stakeholders.

### Business Objectives

The objective is to revamp the current process for the concrete rejected report, making it more efficient. This will be achieved by implementing an automated system with integrated reminders, reducing paper-based forms, and leveraging data analytics for faster decision-making.

### Streamlined Process

The aim is to create a smooth and user-friendly process for the Concrete Rejected Report. By introducing an automated system with timely reminders, we will eliminate tedious paperwork and streamline the workflow. This will enable faster investigation and approval, leading to quicker decision-making and processing.

### Paperless Environment

We will transition to a paperless approach by digitizing the Concrete Rejected Report. This will improve data accessibility and reduce the risk of document loss. The digital platform will enable efficient data retrieval, ensuring all necessary information is readily available for analysis.

### Data-Driven Decisions

With a centralized database, we will track and monitor Concrete Rejected Report in real-time. By analyzing historical data, we can identify patterns, address bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions. This will accelerate the resolution of rejections and enhance overall efficiency.

## Scope of Deliverables

The scope of work for this project includes the following components:

- Web Interface for Request Submission
- Mobile Interface for Notifications and Approvals
- Dashboard for Immediate Action Requests
